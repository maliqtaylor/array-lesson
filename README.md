        An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. Or in simpler terms an array is a way to represent lists in programming.

## Array Use Cases
We have a list of groceries to grab and want to use JavaScript to help us write a program to keep track of our groceries so we don't forget anything. A simple way to represent our grocery list in code could be to create a variable for every item we need.

```js

let itemOne = "apple"
let itemTwo = "peanut butter"
let itemThree = "orange juice"
let itemFour = "almond milk"

```

While this works fine to represent our grocery list it isn't dynamic and it can become tedious to keep track of every item in our grocery list the longer it gets. If we have a grocery list of 10 items it is pretty easy to tell what item number 7 is but if our list is 100 items long finding item number 77 becomes a more time consuming. This is where arrays come in!
