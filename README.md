## Array Use Cases
We have a list of groceries to grab and want to use JavaScript to help us write a program to keep track of our groceries so we don't forget anything. A simple way to represent our grocery list could be to create a variable for every item we need.

```js

let itemOne = "apple"
let itemTwo = "peanut butter"
let itemThree = "orange juice"

```
